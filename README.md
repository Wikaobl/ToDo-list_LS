## Description
This project was created using **_JavaScript, CSS, and HTML_**. You can enter a note in the input field for tasks you need to accomplish and add them to your list. At any time, by clicking the '_usuń_' button, you can remove an item from the list. Thanks to **LocalStorage**, the items you add to the list will remain there even after refreshing the page. If you try to add an empty note, an **alert** will pop up, reminding you to fill in the field.
